# Phase 3 - PROBUM

The final phase involves creating a basic, non-functional prototype of the online testing platform. This prototype focuses on demonstrating the platform's core functionalities and user interactions, rather than implementing all functionalities completely.

**Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:**

Developing the prototype demands a collaborative effort. We will:

- Divide tasks efficiently, ensuring everyone contributes.
- Build the different parts of the prototype according to the designed architecture.
- Integrate these components into a cohesive whole, showcasing the platform's potential.

This hands-on experience provides valuable insights into the feasibility and potential challenges associated with the designed architecture.
