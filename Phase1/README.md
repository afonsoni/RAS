# Phase 1 - PROBUM

This phase lays the foundation for our online testing platform by understanding the needs of its users.

**The Goal:**

Our primary objective is to thoroughly grasp the requirements of various stakeholders involved in the platform. This includes:

- **Professors:** They will create, manage, and administer tests.
- **Students:** They will take the online tests.
- **Administrators:** They will oversee the platform's operation and ensure smooth functionality.


**Teamwork in Action:**

Through brainstorming sessions and open discussions, we'll identify key functionalities and features desired by each user group. These requirements will be meticulously documented, ensuring clarity, completeness, and a shared understanding for future development phases.
