Software Requirements and Architectures (Requisitos e Arquiteturas de Software)

## PROBUM

This project simulates the design of an online testing platform for a university, aiming to complement their existing e-learning system.  Through three collaborative phases, a team of students identified user needs, designed a scalable architecture, and built a basic prototype.

Throughout these phases, a comprehensive requirements document served as the central source of truth, ensuring everyone was aligned on the platform's functionalities and technical specifications.

### Phase 1 - Requirements Gathering

- **The Goal:** Our initial focus was to thoroughly understand the needs of various stakeholders involved in the online testing platform. This included professors who would create and manage tests, students who would take the tests, and administrators who would oversee the platform's operation.
- **Teamwork in Action:** Through brainstorming sessions and discussions, we identified key functionalities and features desired by each user group. We documented these requirements meticulously, ensuring clarity and completeness.

### Phase 2 - Architecture Design

- **Building the Blueprint:** With a clear understanding of the requirements, we transitioned to designing the platform's core architecture. This phase involved outlining the system's components, how data would flow between them, and most importantly, how the platform would integrate seamlessly with the existing university e-learning system.
- **Collaboration is Key:** This design phase heavily relied on teamwork. We discussed various design options, weighed their pros and cons, and ultimately arrived at a robust and efficient architecture that met all the defined requirements.

### Phase 3 - Prototype Development

- **Bringing it to Life:** The final phase involved creating a basic, non-functional prototype of the online testing platform. This prototype focused on demonstrating the platform's core functionalities and user interactions, rather than implementing all the functionalities completely.
- **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:** Developing the prototype was another collaborative effort. We divided the tasks, built the different parts of the prototype, and then integrated them into a cohesive whole. This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into the feasibility of the designed architecture.

### Requirements Document

Throughout these phases, a crucial deliverable was the requirements document. This document served as a vital source of truth, capturing all the functionalities, features, and technical specifications of the platform. It ensured everyone involved was on the same page and provided a clear roadmap for future development.
