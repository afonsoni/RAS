# Phase 2 - PROBUM

With a solid understanding of the gathered requirements, we'll transition to designing the platform's core architecture. This phase focuses on:

- **Outlining system components:** This includes defining the various parts that make up the platform and how they interact.
- **Data Flow Design:** We'll establish how data will flow between these components to ensure smooth operation.
- **Seamless Integration:** A crucial aspect is designing the platform to seamlessly integrate with the existing university e-learning system, promoting a unified learning experience.

**Collaboration is Key:**

This design phase heavily relies on teamwork. We'll discuss various design options, weigh their advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately arrive at a robust and efficient architecture that meets all the defined requirements.
